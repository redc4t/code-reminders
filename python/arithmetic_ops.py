number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0 #arithmetic operators, + is plus, * is multiply, /is divide

print(number)

remainder = 11 % 3 #% is modulo, so returns the remainder of the division

print(remainder)

squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3 #two multiplication symbols creates a power relationship eg. 2 to the power 3

print(squared)
print(cubed)

helloworld = "hello" + "" + "world" #string concatenation using arithmetic operators
print(helloworld)

lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10 #adding multiples of strings using multiplication
print(lotsofhellos)

even = [2,4,6,8]
odd = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd + even
print(all_numbers) #joining lists with addition operator

print([1,2,3] * 3) # forms new list with repeating sequence using multiplication
